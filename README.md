# Asteroids Overview

Asteroids is my implementation of the popular game 'Asteroids' created last century. This game will allow the player to use a ship
and shoot bullets to destroy asteroids around him. Whenever you hit an asteroid it will break into smaller pieces until you get to
the smallest possible type of asteroid and finally it will be destroyed. If you get hit by an asteroid you loose and you'll be prompted
to start over by pressing 's'.

This software is meant to help me understand the principles of Object Oriented Programming, it is build with C++ and I used Visual Studio
2019 as my IDE. As a personal experience I was able to deepen my knowledge on concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, POLYMORPISM and
classes. This project also gave me a better understanding on how pointers work, how to correclty implement data types and how to think as a 
developer.
